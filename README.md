## Xander's Repository

This repository contains:
- The code from all code-alongs; and
- The slides from each day.

___

### 1. Repository Setup

You only need to do this part once, not every time you're syncing your local clone with Xanders's repo.

- **Clone this repository to your computer**
    + *'Cloning' takes Xander's repo on GitHub and creates a local copy (aka 'clone') on your computer.*
    + Hit the **Clone or Download** button in the top right-hand corner of the page and copy the URL to your clipboard.
    + Open Terminal/iTerm2 to the directory in which you intend to store your homework.
    + `git clone git_url_of_this_repo` (where `git_url_of_this_repo` is the URL you copied after hitting 'Clone or Download', above).

### 2. Syncing Your Repo

Do this whenever you want to pull down Xander's code-alongs and slides for the day.

- `cd` into your cloned repo's directory on your computer.
- run `git pull origin master`
